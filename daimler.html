            We partnered with Daimler to create an online game playable on a
            Mercedes Benz Head Unit. We had the unique opportunity to take full
            control, from ideation to design to development, of creating an
            in-vehicle gaming experience for the autonomous driving era.

      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4 portfolio-h3">Problem</h3>
        <h5>
          <p>
            As autonomy and electric vehicle charging become more established in
            the automotive industry, people will have more time on their hands.
            Whether waiting for their cars to charge or waiting to pick up a child
            from school, drivers will have an opportunity to engage in in-vehicle
            entertainment during these times.
          </p>
        </h5>
      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-8">
        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4 portfolio-h3">Process</h3>
        <h5> User Studies </h5>
        <p>
          Our partners are Daimler wanted to know: what kind of games would be
          good in the car?
        </p>
        <p>
          My team began by conducting research and user studies to discover these
          insights. We observed Tesla owners at Supercharger stations to get
          a better understanding of how owners of autonomous and electric
          vehicles spent those moments of down-time while waiting for their
          vehicles to charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ventured to a nearby Tesla dealership to learn more about the current
          status of in-car gaming. I was able to sit in different models and
          inspect Tesla display units, as well as play around with their games
          such as Stardew Valley. Before I left, I got the chance to test-drive
          the Tesla Model 3 around the neighborhood!
        </p>

        <h5> Ideation </h5>
        <p>
          My team then went through many ideation stages, coming up with as many
          games as possible and then narrowing them down based on our findings
          and constraints. Some of our initial ideas from the first brainstorming session
          included board games like LIFE and Monopoly, immersive experiences
          like Mario Kart and Pokemon Go, and old school games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second round of brainstorming, we focused on aspects
          of the in-car gaming experience we wanted to emphasis. We knew that
          the game should capitalize on the unique circumstances and people
          inside of the car. Some of our ideas here included trivia, karaoke,
          20 questions, and Mafia.

          With helpful feedback from our Daimler liaisons, we decided to move
          forward with 3 ideas: trivia, karaoke, and Draw Something.
        </p>

        <h5> Prototypes and Findings </h5>
        <p>
          We rapidly-prototyped these 3 ideas by creating quick pen-and-paper
          versions of each game, which meant to test the interactions
          that friends and family playing together would have.
          <!-- TODO: images of prototype and testing -->

          We set up the environment to mimic the inside of a car, and recruited
          participants that represented the demographic we were aiming for. Our
          key insights were:

          <ul>
            <li> Friends love inside jokes </li>
            <li> People are competitive </li>
            <li> Users wanted to continue playing </li>
          </ul>

          With our findings and input from our Daimler liaisons, we settled on
          developing a unique in-vehicle trivia game.
        </p>

        <h5> Design </h5>
        <p>
          The main aspects of our design were that it fit nicely within
          Daimler's existing head unit UI, and that it felt like an exciting,
          futuristic game. As lead product designer, I took charge of designing
          the low-fi wireframes as well as high-fi working prototypes and components.
          This is our clickable Figma prototype.

        <h3 class="mt-4 mb-4 portfolio-h3">Solution</h3>
          <p>
            Finally, we used React and Firebase to engineer a fully-functional,
            dynamic trivia game complete with user profiles, scores and leaderboard,
            and a variety of categories, including a location-based one! Give our
            game a try here!
