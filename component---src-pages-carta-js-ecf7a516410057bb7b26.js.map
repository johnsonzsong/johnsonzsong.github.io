How did students use filters? What parameters did they filter by and in what order? What filters were desired?\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Through user interviews, I found that filters on the search results page were used in few limited cases. Students often entered exact-string queries of the course in question, and so didn’t always need to further filter results.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              However, a compelling use case for filters among students was in finding <b>one last course</b> - a filler course to complete their quarter schedule. The most frequently-used filters to help with this scenario was narrowing results by quarter, number of units, and fulfillment of graduation requirements (WAYS requirements).\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"audits\" className=\"wide stack\">\n          <h2>Comparator Audits.</h2>\n          <p className=\"col-60\">\n            Next, I found analogous search experiences to help explore and understand different search flows a user might take. Below are a couple of the numerous factors I considered when looking at existing search patterns, including what how filters were updated, how more filters were shown, and how search results were surfaced and categorized. I did this for Airbnb and Yelp (shown below) as well as for Fitness Blender, YouTube, Spotify, and more.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"col-60 mb-32\">\n            These helped inform some of my initial low-fidelity mockups, as I explored different filtering, search results, and search bar interactions.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"multi-image\">\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaAudit1}></img>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaAudit2}></img>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"section-three\" className=\"wide stack mb-32\">\n          <h2>Medium-Fidelity.</h2>\n          <p className=\"col-60\">\n          With this context, I embarked on concretizing my findings into rough, grayscale prototypes. The goal was to capture the essential hierarchies and layouts at a high level. I spent the majority of my time at this stage, practicing the <b>flare and focus</b> design thinking principle through 1. filtering search results and 2. navigating between different types of search results.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"med-fi-filters\" className=\"wide\">\n          <div className=\"col-60 multi-image-vertical\">\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaFilterFlare1}></img>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaFilterFlare2}></img>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaFilterFlare3}></img>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-35\">\n            <h2>Filtering Results.</h2>\n            <p>\n              I considered multiple ways of representing the information hierarchies implied by filters. In one version, I tried out a collapsible panel at the top of the page that either displayed or hid all possible filters. In the second, I explored a slide-out drawer which contained all filters. In the third, I tried out a row of dropdown selections with most salient filters, and then additional filters in a popup modal.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              My fellow designers and I evaluated the merits of each approach. Liam and Kaelyn appreciated the way a row of relevant filters gave users context for their search, and noted that the first two variations were lacking this context. Jordan and Kaelyn were cautious of using a popup modal, since it had the reverse effect of bringing the user out of context - it might have been too jarring, especially because it covered the underlying search results.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I took my team's feedback and decided on a hybrid approach that used dropdown selections for the most-used filters, alongside a \"More Filters\" button that would open up a side panel drawer. Of note, I also focused on giving users feedback on which filters they selected, including a thorough consideration of ways that active/selected states can be leveraged to show which filters were applied.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        {/* TODO: section about binary filter states or search bar?*/}\n\n        <section id=\"med-fi-search\" className=\"wide\">\n          <div className=\"col-60 multi-image-vertical\">\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaSearchFlare1}></img>\n            </div>\n            {/* <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaSearchFlare2}></img>\n            </div> */}\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-35\">\n            <h2>Navigating Results.</h2>\n            <p>\n              One peculiarity of Carta search results is that there are multiple <i>types</i> of results: courses, professors/teaching staff, or even departments. This challenged me to design for smooth, intuitive navigation. My first attempt used a tabbed navigation to switch between all results, courses, people, and departments. Tabs were a natural course since they would be used to <b>logically chunk</b> results that were <b>parallel in nature</b>. Additionally, they were already used throughout numerous other pages on Carta. Shoutout to Liam for sharing a <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/\" target=\"_blank\">great article from Nielsen Norman Group</a> about using tabs that helped inform this approach.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I also tried using buttons (inspired by LinkedIn search) to navigate between result types. LinkedIn provided a great comparison, since it has the same pattern - search results include companies, job opportunities, people, posts, and more. Exploring this pattern gave me insights about how filter sets could be dynamic depending on type of result the user is looking at.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"med-fi-insights\" className=\"wide stack\">\n          <h2>Putting it All Together.</h2>\n          <p className=\"col-60 mb-32\">\n            The final medium-fidelity design I settled on is shown below. A major decision I made was to scrap the \"All Results\" tab. Since our research showed that students are searching for courses in the majority of cases (~90% of the time), it would reduce friction to just display the courses as a default. Similarly, since showing an \"All Results\" tab would always require students to have to specifically switch to Courses, or People, or Departments, I decided that removing this would bring them one step closer to an intuitive and efficient search flow, without sacrificing the experience.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"multi-image\">\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaMedFinal1}></img>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"image-container\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaMedFinal2}></img>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"section-four\" className=\"wide stack\">\n          <h2>High-Fidelity.</h2>\n          <p className=\"col-60 mb-32\">\n            Finally, I polished my wireframes by ensuring that I was using all patterns, components, and colors consistently within our design system. Then, I linked up the interactions into a fully-funtional, usable prototype that would help the hand-off process to the development team. I also included commentary on expected behaviors for the flows, including cases for null results, different search queries, and peculiarities in filter criteria.\n          </p>\n          <div className=\"multi-image col-80\">\n            <div className=\"image-container nb\">\n              <img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={cartaHiFi2}></img>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <section id=\"section-five\" className=\"wide\">\n          <div className=\"col-60 multi-image\">\n            <div className=\"insight-container\">\n              <div className=\"insight-number\">1</div>\n              Overcommunicate.

I wouldn't want to have had my first structured design critiques, brainstorming sessions, and design banters with anyone else - so huge huge shoutout to my design team: Kristina, Liam, Jordan, and Kaelyn.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              I was surprised by both how much I knew, and how little I knew, of the design process. Sure, I'd heard of and practiced needfinding, brainstorming, and prototyping before. However, I didn't realize how many wild and exciting directions design could take me, with a feature as seemingly straightforward as filters, no less! I am excited to continue applying what I've learned to future design - and even engineering - projects.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n\n        <div className=\"bottom-buttons-container\">\n          <div className=\"project-button-container mt-64\">\n            <Link to=\"/goodreads\">\n              <button className=\"project-button\">Prev: Goodreads</button>\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"project-button-container mt-64\">\n            <Link to=\"/daimler\">\n              <button className=\"project-button\">Next: Daimler</button>\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    </PageTransition>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Carta;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/cartaHiFi1-4054184b06c93abde936a3dab7aaa3d6.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/cartaHiFi2-762cc0781c90f74f9bc22985cb46110c.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/cartaHiFi3-3cafb706e000986b7f2c07ce0a9c0123.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/cartaFilterFlare2-7eb93c2965bc64153fc87fc71b70cf7e.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
