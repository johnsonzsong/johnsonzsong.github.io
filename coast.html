            I spent 10 weeks designing, prototyping, and manufacturing a set

        <h5>
          <p>
            I wanted to create meaningful, high-quality gifts for the most avid
            (and important) tea drinkers in my life: my mom and dad!
            My main design goal was to incorporate a sense of togetherness while
            I am thousands of miles away from them. I also wanted to
            pay homage to their love for gardening and plants, which led to the
            cherry blossom (common around our hometown) and palm tree
            (common around campus) details. Practically speaking, the wood
            element was an elegant solution to protect surfaces from being
            scratched.

        <h5> Sketches and Rapid Prototypes </h5>
        <p>
          During the initial stages of ideation, I brainstormed dozens of potential
          project ideas. For my top 3 ideas after consultation with my class mentor,
          I sketched a couple drawings of the product's <b> meaning </b> and
          projected <b> scope</b>.

            <img src="images/portfolio/coast-scope.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50">
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          My first rapid prototyping attempt led me to Room 36, the "digital prototyping"
          hub of the Stanford Product Realization Lab. I laser-cut a couple of
          coasters out of 1/8th-inch Duron. Each coaster had a removable center
          piece, which allowed me to visualize the negative space that I intended
          to fill with epoxy resin or another piece.

        <h5> CAD Models and Operations Sequence </h5>
        <p>
          Creating detailed CAD models that included draft angles, fillet radii,
          and accurate dimensions proved to be immensely helpful since they were
          directly used to generated the 3D-printed pieces for my pattern. I iterated
          through 10 (yes, 10!) versions of each CAD model (California and Virginia), adjusting dimensions
          and angles to allow for cleaner pulls in the sandcasting process (see below).
          Here are my very first CAD models:

          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          And here are my final CAD models:

          </div>
        </p>

        <h5> Design </h5>
        <p>
          My aha moment occurred when I was drinking tea one evening.
          Just outside my window, I saw the tops of palm trees sway in the
          breeze, and I was suddenly reminded of my parentsâ€™ love for plants and
          gardening. I followed this thread of inspiration, which led to the
          calming palm trees and cherry blossoms you will find in my final product.
        </p>

        <h5> Manufacturing Process </h5>
        <p>
          I handmade a custom pattern board, gate, and runner for my patterns in
          the woodshop. Shellac and the spindle sander became my best friends in
          this process, as I had to make sure the draft angles of the gate and
          runner were perfectly compatible with my patterns, and that the wood
          of the board wasn't too porous.
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img src="images/portfolio/coast-shellac.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50">
            <img src="images/portfolio/coast-spindle.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50">
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason I had to make 10 versions of each CAD model was to ensure
          that my patterns would pull cleanly from the sand when I rammed sand
          on them. The ramming process itself was surprisingly fun and also
          a great workout - essentially, you're packing pounds and pounds of
          sand on top of your pattern board in order to imprint the pattern
          into the sand. This requires an increasing amount of force as the layers
          get taller, while maintaining delicacy so that the patterns don't move
          around. A helpful metaphor is to imagine each layer of sand like tectonic
          plates which, when rubbed against each other, can cause the entire
          product to crack.
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img src="images/portfolio/coast-ram.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50">
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          A clean pull maintains all the fine detail of the original pattern,
          and doesn't have any "wash," or areas where the sand fell apart and
          crumpled. Because my pulls from my first few iterations of patterns
          indicated that some aspects of the designs were too thin (and thus
          very fragile when the pull was lifted), I had to innovate on the design
          in thoughtful ways.
          <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <img src="images/portfolio/coast-pull1.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50">
            <img src="images/portfolio/coast-pull2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50">
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I was happy with how the sand pulls and bronze pours turned out,
          I had to spend an overwhelming amount of time sanding the surface of my
          coasters. Starting with 60-grit sandpaper, then moving to 80, then 150,
          200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and finally 1,200, I spent hours and hours
          sanding away at the surface of my coasters to achieve a spotless shine.
          This was the most incredible and rewarding, though tiresome and frustrating,
          part of the entire process. It was critical that I be patient at the lower
          grits in order to smooth out any kinks in the bronze. If I ever moved
          up to a higher grit too soon, I'd have to start all over at the lower grits
          to get the imperfections out (since the higher grit sandpaper could no
          longer smooth out larger divets). At the end of it all, I polished
          the bronze with some wax paste and admired the mirror-like reflectivity
          on the surface!

            <img src="images/portfolio/coast-sanding.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid w-50">
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          I split my time between sanding and woodworking, since I also decided
          to inlay my pieces in a wooden frame. The purpose of this wood frame
          was twofold, as I wanted to add an element of wood-metal interaction
          while at the same time providing functional value to the coasters with
          a base that would protect surfaces from being scratched. The process
          of creating this wooden frame included sawing the wood, routing the middle
          radius out, sanding it to smooth edges, and finally staining and sealing
          to make it liquid-proof. After all, these are coasters that must withstand
          spills and washes!
