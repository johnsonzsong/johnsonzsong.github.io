We found there to be an unique opportunity to frame the in-vehicle entertainment experience as not one that sought to replace smartphones, but one to complement them. We positioned these games as a way to strengthen relationships in a low-barrier, intuitive, and engaging format.\n            </p>\n            <br />\n            <p>\n              We rapid-prototyped our ideas with pen-and-paper versions of each game, which meant to test the interactions that friends and family playing together would have. Then, we set up a car-like experience by arranging chairs as if they were the seats in a car, and taping a makeshift head-unit display to the wall in front of them.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"image-container mt-32 nb\">\n              <img style={{ width: \"50%\", alignSelf: \"center\" }} src={cabanaPrototype2}></img>\n            </div>\n            <p className=\"mt-32\">\n              At this stage, we wanted to test our assumptions about interactions that people with close ties would have in a car. We told our participants to imagine they were on a long road trip in an autonomous vehicle. Their genuine friendships with each other were representative of our target segment, which primarily consisted of family with children along with groups of young adults (roommates, best friends, etc.).\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"multi-image mt-32\">\n              <div className=\"insight-container\">\n                <div className=\"insight-number\">1</div>\n                <br />\n                People love inside jokes, and build off of each other's energies to demonstrate depth of their relationship.\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"insight-container\">\n                <div className=\"insight-number\">2</div>\n                <br />\n                Friends love to compete against each other, especially if grouped into teams.\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"insight-container\">\n                <div className=\"insight-number\">3</div>\n                <br />\n                People want a chance to redeem themselves if they lose.

I led wireframing, starting with simple, low-fidelity flows to capture the important steps along a player's journey. The crucial aspects we wanted to pin down were designing for a touch-screen device, designing for user by multiple users at varying distances, and creating an intuitive, uncluttered interface.\n            </p>\n            <div className=\"multi-image mt-32\">\n              <div className=\"image-container\">\n                <img style={{ width: \"100%\" }} src={cabanaMedFi1}></img>\n              </div>\n              {/* <div className=\"image-container\">\n                <img style={{ width: \"100%\" }} src={cabanaMedFi2}></img>\n              </div> */}\n              <div className=\"image-container\">\n                <img style={{ width: \"100%\" }} src={cabanaMedFi3}></img>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </section>\n\n          <section>\n            <h2>HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>\n            <p className=\"mb-32\">\n              Before diving into development, I led efforts to create a fully-interactive high-fidelity prototype. This included defining a basic typographic system, color palette, and visual identity. With the help of a moodboard, we aimed to create a futuristic yet familiar, sleek, and bold vibe that could appeal across generations.
