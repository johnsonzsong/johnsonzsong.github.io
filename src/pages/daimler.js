                As part of a senior capstone project course at Stanford, my team and I partnered with Daimler to create a multiplayer touchscreen game for the Mercedes-Benz Head Unit. Our liaisons at Daimler were interested in uncovering insights about in-vehicle entertainment in the autonomous driving era.

            <h2>User Research.</h2>
            <p>
              As autonomy and electric vehicle charging become more established in the automotive industry, drivers will have an increasing opportunity to engage with in-vehicle entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
              My team conducted user studies by observing and interviewing Tesla owners at Supercharger stations. We wanted to gain a better understanding of how owners of autonomous and electric vehicles spent those moments of down-time while waiting for their vehicles to charge. We also took a trip to the nearby Palo Alto Tesla dealership to learn more about the current status of in-car gaming from Tesla employees and electric vehicle owners. Here are two user personas to represent the aggregate profile of over 50 total interviews.

            <h2>Brainstorm and Affinity Mapping.</h2>
            <p>
              My team then went through many ideation stages, first coming up with as many games as possible and then narrowing them down based on our findings and constraints. Some of our initial ideas from the first brainstorming session included board games like LIFE and Monopoly, immersive experiences like Mario Kart and Pokemon Go, and old school games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the second round of brainstorming, we focused on aspects of the in-car gaming experience we wanted to emphasis. We knew that the game should capitalize on the unique circumstances and people inside of the car. We grouped these ideas into an affinity map to help structure our goals.

            <h2>Rapid Prototyping.</h2>
            <p>
            With helpful feedback from our Daimler liaisons, we decided to move forward with 3 ideas: trivia, karaoke, and Draw Something. We brought our user research, insights, and brainstorm to our Daimler liaisons in their Sunnyvale office and received valuable feedback to consider moving forward in our prototyping stages.
            </p>
            <p>
              We rapidly-prototyped these 3 ideas by creating quick pen-and-paper versions of each game, which meant to test the interactions that friends and family playing together would have. Then, we set up a car-like experience by arranging chairs as if they were the seats in a car, and taping a makeshift head-unit display to the wall in front of them.

          <div style={{width: "40%"}}>
            <h2>Medium-Fidelity.</h2>
            <p>
              Among the games that we rapidly-prototyped, we felt that trivia offered the best mixture of positive feedback from testers, alignment with Daimler's vision, and our timeframe. We went ahead and started to create simple wireframes for our medium-fidelity prototype. Some key features that we were sure to keep in mind were designing for a touch-screen, designing for use by multiple people at various distances, and creating an intuitive, uncluttered interface.

          <div style={{width: "40%"}}>
            <h2>High-Fidelity and MVP.</h2>
            <p>
              In transitioning from medium-fidelity to high-fidelity, we used a moodboard to get at the core essence of the ambience (aka ~vibe~) we wanted for the game. We wanted the game, and more importantly, the entire in-vehicle gaming experience to exude futuristic yet familiar, sleek, luxurious, and bold. It was meant to be appealing for children and teenagers easily distracted by phones, and also be a nod to more retro games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders.
            </p>
            <p>
              With our high-fidelity designs, we were ready for development. We used React on the frontend UI paired with Firebase to store player data like usernames and high scores. Check out our interactive prototype below. But don't stop there -- you can actually play our live game by clicking on the play button!
