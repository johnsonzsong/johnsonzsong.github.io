            Goodreads is the worldâ€™s largest site for readers and book recommendations. According to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/about/us" target="_blank">Goodreads website</a>, its mission is to help people find and share books they love.

                Instead of roadtripping through Joshua Tree and Death Valley for spring break this year, I decided to embark on a different kind of journey - a UX/UI case study and redesign of Goodreads. Over the course of one week, I researched, tested, and prototyped a reimagined mobile experience for Goodreads. This project was not endorsed by, directly affiliated with, maintained, authorized, or sponsored by Goodreads.

              One of the biggest painpoints of Goodreads was its obscure exploration and recommendation flows. While Goodreads has plenty of these resources in place, they are hard to find and underutilized.

            <h2>User Research & Affinity Mapping.</h2>
            <p>
                My first step towards better understanding the ways in which readers used the Goodreads mobile app was conducting user research. In previous projects, this might have meant conducting user interviews at a coffee shop. However, given the unique context of the situation (COVID-19), I decided to take a more digital approach. I turned to Reddit as a method of crowd-sourced needfinding. I read through a handful of recent threads in which Goodreads users vented about frustrations they found with the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to gathering insights from Reddit forums, I also reached out to friends that I knew were active on Goodreads. This allowed me to have more in-depth conversations about painpoints, joys, and behaviors within the app. I distilled important learnings and quotes from this combination of crowd-sourced and individual interviews, organizing them on sticky notes. I then used affinity mapping to help categorize these findings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond qualms with the clunky interface of the current Goodreads mobile app, I identified two themes to the user feedback. The first was a tension between <b>being social</b> on the app and engaging with friends' reading activities, and wanting to purely track <b>personal activity</b>. The other was a frustration at the limited emphasis Goodreads placed on <b>discoverability of books</b>.

          <h2>Comparator Audits.</h2>
          <p className="col-60">
            After my preliminary research, my next step was to conduct comparator audits of similar apps and UX patterns found in Goodreads. I looked at both existing reading app competitors such as Reading List and Libib, as well as apps in different domains but with similar patterns, like Spotify's explore flow and playlist library and Twitter's social feed. Below are some annotated screenshots of my comparative analyses.

            My user research, affinity mapping, and comparator audits provided the groundwork to explore basic grayscale wireflows to tackle the painpoints and opportunity spaces that I uncovered. I approached my ideation and prototype stage by focusing on the three categories identified in the user research: <b>social, discovery, and record-keeping.</b>

            <h2>Social.</h2>
            <p>
              The current Goodreads app opens to a home screen that attempts to do it all: there is a search bar to look up books by title, author, or ISBN; there are social updates from friends' reading activity; and there are recommendations from Goodreads based on your reading history. This is confusing to the user because there's <b>no clear primary function</b> of the home page!
            </p>
            <p>
              My social explorations aimed to provide <b>focus</b> to the homepage. If it was to be social, then I believed I could better leverage the social aspects of reading that Goodreads users loved. Thus, one flow I explored was an activity feed that could be toggled between self-view and friend-view (a la Venmo). Here, the focus is clear: the homepage is a hub for engaging with readers, and there is a clear distinction between what is <i>yours</i> versus what is <i>your friends'</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also explored a flow in which the homepage served mainly for personal discovery. In this version, social activity is not present at all on the homepage, and instead are accessible through the user's profile (and consequently, friends). Instead, the homepage gives recommendations and easy entry points to discover genres and books.

            <h2>Discovery.</h2>
            <p>
              Currently, the Goodreads mobile app has one navigation item called "Discover" and one for "Search." Yet the "Discover" has absolutely no personalization based on user reading history whatsoever -- if the user wanted to get curated recommendations, they would have to go to an obscure page within their profile called "Recommendations." Bottom line? <b>Discoverability was a heavily underutilized feature that users wanted but could rarely find easily.</b> Additionally, having both "Search" and "Discoverability" felt like a redundant pattern that cluttered the navigation bar and offered little extra utility for users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, my medium-fidelity explorations for discovery aimed to make use of <b>personalized content and easy discoverability</b>.

            <h2>Record-Keeping.</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most-used features for users of Goodreads is to keep track of reading history, including books they're currently reading and books they want to read. This means being able to add books to their appropriate collections, and modify them easily. Simplicity is key in this interaction, since tracking books happens frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
                The existing Goodreads app makes it surprisingly difficult and unintuitive how to add books to a collection. For example, within a "shelf", there is no explicit call-to-action for users to add books. This process is hidden in the three-dot menu at the top right corner of the page. Additionally, while there is a way to search for books within all shelves at once, it's impossible to search for books within a particular shelf.
            </p>
            <p>
                My explorations sought to simplify the user's library, making it easier to navigate, view, and modify collections. I also explored how to make it more explicit what content was private versus what was public, since my research found that people were often confused.
