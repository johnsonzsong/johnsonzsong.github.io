                My project over the course of 10 weeks was to redesign the course search process. Specifically, I conducted user research and comparator studies, and created low-to-high fidelity designs for the search results page.

            <p>
              My primary research focus was uncovering insights about the course filtering process. How did students use filters? What parameters did they filter by and in what order? What filters were desired?
            </p>
            <p>
              Through user interviews, I found that filters on the search results page were used in few limited cases. Students often entered exact-string queries of the course in question, and so didnâ€™t always need to further filter results.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, a compelling use case for filters among students was in finding <b>one last course</b> - a filler course to complete their quarter schedule. The most frequently-used filters to help with this scenario was narrowing results by number of units and fulfillment of graduation requirements (WAYS requirements).

          <h2>Comparator Audits.</h2>
          <p className="col-60">
            Next, I found analogous search experiences to help explore and understand different search flows a user might take. Below are a couple of the numerous factors I considered when looking at existing search patterns, including what how filters were updated, how more filters were shown, and how search results were surfaced and categorized. I did this for Airbnb and Yelp (shown below) as well as for Fitness Blender, YouTube, Spotify, and more.

            These helped inform some of my initial low-fidelity mockups, as I explored different filtering, search results, and search bar interactions.

            With this context, I embarked on concretizing my findings into rough, grayscale prototypes. The goal was to capture the essential hierarchies and elements at a high level. I spent the majority of my time at this stage, flaring out into a huge variety of variations in what this search experience might look like.
