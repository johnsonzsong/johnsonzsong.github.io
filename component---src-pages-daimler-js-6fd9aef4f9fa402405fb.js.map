Then, we set up a car-like experience by arranging chairs as if they were the seats in a car, and taping a makeshift head-unit display to the wall in front of them.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        {/* TODO: KEY INSIGHTS SECTION TO CONNECT PROTOTYPE TO MED-FI.

We went ahead and started to create simple wireframes for our medium-fidelity prototype. Some key features that we were sure to keep in mind were designing for a touch-screen, designing for use by multiple people at various distances, and creating an intuitive, uncluttered interface.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </section>\n        <section id=\"section-five\" className=\"wide\">\n          <img src={cabanaFeature} style={{\n            width: \"50%\"\n          }}></img>\n          <div style={{width: \"40%\"}}>\n            <h2>High-Fidelity and MVP.</h2>\n            <p>\n              In transitioning from medium-fidelity to high-fidelity, we used a moodboard to get at the core essence of the ambience (aka ~vibe~) we wanted for the game. We wanted the game, and more importantly, the entire in-vehicle gaming experience to exude futuristic yet familiar, sleek, luxurious, and bold. It was meant to be appealing for children and teenagers easily distracted by phones, and also be a nod to more retro games like Pac-Man and Space Invaders.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              With our high-fidelity designs, we were ready for development.
